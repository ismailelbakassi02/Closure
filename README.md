Functional Dependency Closure Calculator
This program is designed to assist in understanding and manipulating relational schemas and their functional dependencies (FDs). It allows users to:

Define a relational schema with attributes.
Input functional dependencies for the schema.
Calculate the closure of a given set of attributes to identify implied attributes.
Features:
Interactive CLI interface for schema and FD input.
Clear step-by-step process to ensure user-friendly functionality.
Algorithm to compute closure efficiently.
Flexibility in modifying schema or dependencies during execution.
Technologies Used:
C Programming Language
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc for managing dependencies.
How to Use:
Enter the name of your relation and define its attributes.
Input the functional dependencies (left-hand and right-hand attributes).
Specify the attribute set for closure calculation.
View the computed closure of the specified attributes.
Potential Use Cases:
Academic purposes to learn relational theory.
Quick calculations of closures for database normalization tasks.
